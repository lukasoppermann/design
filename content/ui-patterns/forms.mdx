## Form control anatomy

![diagrams labeling the anatomy of a text field and a checkbox field](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164065184-e3c615a3-fb68-4878-b7f8-9a57efb748cb.png )

### Label (required)

Labels should be descriptive, and as short as possible: ideally no more than 3 words. Labels should be written in sentence case. For example: "Repository name".

If you're having trouble keeping label text short, consider using a [caption](#caption) to provide more context.

In rare cases, a label may be hidden when the user has enough context to understand what the input does. When a label is visually hidden, label text must still be provided for assistive technology such as screen readers. For example: a search field with an icon that is placed in the spot a user would expect to find a search field may have a visually hidden label that says "Search".

Placeholder text is never an acceptable substitute for a form control label because:

- The placeholder text disappears as soon as the input has a value
- Placeholder text colors are typically too light to meet the minimum color contrast ratio required to be accessible
- Screen readers do not read placeholder text

    <Caption>Don’t use a placeholder as a substitute for a label</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Required field indicator

When a field is required to have a value, it should be visibly marked as required. An individual checkbox or radio cannot be marked as required.

For more information, see the [required fields](#required-fields) section.

### Input (required)

The input is what the user interacts with to set the value of the input. You may pre-fill inputs with smart default values, but be careful about making too many assumptions about what a user wants or needs.

The input must have a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 to pass WCAG AA-compliance. This is defined in [WCAG success criterion 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).

### Caption

A caption may be used to provide additional context about the field to help users fill in the correct data or explain how the data will be used. Caption text should be as short as possible.

Caption text may be displayed alongside a validation message, or it may be hidden if it only provides redundant information.

Caption text may be used to augment the [label](#label), but should not be redundant with the label or any other parts of the form control. If the caption feels redundant, try removing it.

    <Caption>Don’t use caption text that is redundant</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Validation message

A single validation message may be displayed to provide helpful information for a user to complete their task. For example: explain why a value is invalid so they can correct it and submit the form.

An individual checkbox or radio should not have its own validation.

    <Caption>Don’t show a validation message for each input</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Information from the caption should not be repeated in the error message. Show the validation message and remove the caption. A validation message makes the field easier to spot when a user is scanning for invalid fields.

## Input methods

### Open-ended text

![Text input, open-ended autocomplete text input, plain text input, textarea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164782311-93a743fb-7757-4f29-bc74-522408a01b5c.png)

Use an open-ended text field when the field does not have a list of possible values. If the input is able to suggest values, use [autocomplete](#autocomplete) to allow users to pick a value or enter their own.

### A set of selectable options

![Action menu, autocomplete input with limited options, checkbox group, radio group, select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164782313-851a5a90-8c50-409f-b03d-4200928e0a67.png)

Show a set of selectable options when there is a finite number of possible values.

## Structure

Forms should have a structure that makes it easy for users to scan. Form controls that are stacked vertically and left-aligned are easier for sighted users to scan visually.

    <Caption>Don’t lay out forms into columns just to reduce the vertical space used by the form</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Order of form controls

Form fields should be in a predictable order that flows intuitively.

To achieve an intuitive flow:
- Order fields by their relative level of importance
- Keep related fields near each other
- When possible, keep inputs that require keyboard input near each other so that users who use a mouse don't have to switch back and forth between clicking and typing

### Grouping form controls

<Box mb={3} display="flex" alignItems="flex-start" flexDirection={["column", "column", "column", "column", "row"]} sx={{gap: 3}}>
    <img
        width="456"
        alt="visually grouped of related inputs"
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164065207-16e51727-55b2-48bc-930c-ad9f0890ae10.png"
    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">When there is a collection of closely related fields, they should be labeled and visually grouped together. Effective techniques to visually group a collection of form controls include proximity and whitespace.</Box>
</Box>

### Progressively disclosed form controls

    <img
        width="456"

    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">To keep forms concise, you may choose to hide or show form controls based on selections the user has made.</Box>
</Box>

#### Nested form controls

Sometimes, progressively disclosed form controls can be visually nested under a parent form control. A common pattern is to use a checkbox or radio “checked” state to decide whether to show a related form control.

<Box mb={3} display="flex" alignItems="flex-start" flexDirection={["column", "column", "column", "column", "row"]} sx={{gap: 3}}>

    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">If the parent form control provides sufficient visual context, you may visually hide the label. However, you must specify text for a visually hidden label that is accessible to screen readers.</Box>

        />
    </div>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">If the parent form control does not provide sufficient context, a visible label should be shown. Make sure the label of the nested form control doesn’t clash with the label of its parent form control.</Box>
</Box>

## Validation

### Use Primer for validation

Use Primer instead of browser-native validation UI. Browser-native validation messages are not accessible to screen readers, and they visually clash with Primer styles.

### Validation statuses

<Box mb={3} display="flex" alignItems="flex-start" flexDirection={["column", "column", "column", "column", "row"]} sx={{gap: 3}}>
  <Box flexGrow={1} flexBasis="0">
    <img
        alt="input with forbidden characters"
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164065220-30c25ca4-827f-4327-95f4-9be888272813.png"
    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0"><strong>Error messages:</strong> An invalid field should always have a message explaining why the value does not pass validation. The message should explain why the value is invalid, and unblock users from completing their task by guiding them to a valid value.</Box>
  </Box>

    <img
        alt="valid repo name success"
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/164065221-7e4f6a21-e9a7-465b-9a86-83c61533fdec.png"
    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0"><strong>Success messages:</strong> A success message may be used when a user might need extra assurance that the field's value is valid. For example: when creating a repository name, it’s nice to be assured that the name is available and valid.</Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

### Validation on submit

The default behavior of the web is to perform validation when the user attempts to submit the form. This lets the user flow quickly through the form without interruption, but the user has to wait until submitting the form to know if they’ve entered invalid data. 

When the form fails validation, the first invalid input should be focused and scrolled into the viewport.

After a form has failed validation, you may switch to inline validation to provide quicker feedback than if you made the user re-submit the form to re-check validation statuses.

### Inline validation

Inline validation provides immediate feedback as the user is entering data. For example: when setting a username, you could show a success message if the name is available or an error message if it’s taken.

<Box mb={3} display="flex" alignItems="flex-start" flexDirection={["column", "column", "column", "column", "row"]} sx={{gap: 3}}>
    <img
        width="456"

    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">If the form control is in a valid state, validation should be performed until after the user has made a change to the input <strong>and has removed focus from the input</strong>.</Box>

    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">We shouldn’t attempt to validate an input before the user is done with it. So validation may be performed as the user is typing or making their selection, but only <strong>after the first time the input has been validated</strong> and the <strong>input is in an invalid state</strong>. This gives the user early positive feedback by removing the error if the user makes a change that fixes it.</Box>
</Box>

<Box mb={3} display="flex" alignItems="flex-start" flexDirection={["column", "column", "column", "column", "row"]} sx={{gap: 3}}>

    />
    <Box as="p" mt="0">If the form control’s validation is likely to take more than 1 second, show a loading indicator.</Box>
</Box>

<Note variant="warning">
  Inline validation offers immediate feedback, but carefully weigh that with the following drawbacks.

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Negative impact on perceived performance when validating server-side:</strong> Inline validation works best with data that can be checked instantly with client-side validation. Using server-side validation for inline validation could make the app feel slow because the user has to wait for the server to send back a validation response.</li>

  <li><strong>Interrupted flow for screen reader users:</strong> Inline validation isn’t as disruptive for sighted users because they can choose to ignore the errors until they’re ready to fix them. When a screen reader user moves focus from the invalid input to the next form control, they will be interrupted by the validation message of the previous form control.</li>
  </ul>
</Note>

### Validating a group of form controls

    <Box as="p" mt="0">A validation message may be used to describe an error for a group of form controls. For example: if a user checks 3 checkboxes when they’re only allowed to check 2 options.</Box>
